# ðŸŸ  IPv4 Attacks

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is still widely used today and continues to be a target for various cyberattacks. Here are some common IPv4 attacks that you, as a cybersecurity practitioner, should be aware of:

1. **IP Spoofing:** Attackers can forge the source IP address of packets to impersonate trusted entities. This can lead to various security issues, including unauthorized access and data interception.
2. **DDoS Attacks:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks flood a target system with an overwhelming volume of traffic. In IPv4, attackers can use botnets to amplify the attack, causing service disruption.
3. **Smurf Attack:** This involves sending ICMP echo request (ping) packets with a forged source IP address to a broadcast address, causing multiple hosts to reply to the victim with ICMP replies. This amplifies the attack and can overwhelm the target.
4. **Fragmentation Attacks:** Attackers can exploit the way IPv4 handles packet fragmentation to evade detection and reassemble malicious payloads on the target system.
5. **IP Address Exhaustion:** With the limited pool of IPv4 addresses, attackers may try to exhaust available IP addresses on a network, causing disruptions and making it difficult for legitimate users to connect.
6. **Port Scanning:** Attackers use tools to scan for open ports on target systems, looking for vulnerabilities or services to exploit.
7. **IP-Based Geolocation Attacks:** Attackers can use knowledge of IP address ranges associated with specific regions to target and tailor attacks based on geographic locations.
